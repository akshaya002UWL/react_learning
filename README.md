Sure, here is an updated 30-day plan to master ReactJS, along with the best tutorials for each:

Day 1-5: Learn the Basics

Learn the fundamentals of JavaScript. You can start with the freeCodeCamp JavaScript course.
Get familiar with React concepts such as components, JSX, state, and props. Follow the official React documentation's Getting Started guide.
Follow an introductory course or tutorial to build your first React application. Try the React Fundamentals course on Pluralsight.
Practice writing simple React components and experiment with changing their properties. Complete the React components section of the React Fundamentals course on Pluralsight.
Day 6-10: Dive Deeper

Learn about React lifecycles, events, and hooks. Try the React Hooks course on Scrimba.
Experiment with various React libraries such as React Router, Redux, and Material-UI. Follow the React Router tutorial on the official documentation.
Build a small React project using these libraries to get hands-on experience. Try building a simple e-commerce website using Material-UI and Redux.
Review and improve your code by reading the documentation and experimenting with different patterns. Refer to the official documentation and follow the best practices.
Day 11-15: Build More Complex Projects

Start building more complex React applications, such as e-commerce sites, social media applications, or blogs. Follow the React projects course on Scrimba.
Learn how to handle asynchronous data with React, such as fetching data from an API and rendering it in your application. Try the Fetching Data with React course on Pluralsight.
Experiment with React forms, validation, and user input handling. Try the React forms course on Scrimba.
Practice building reusable components and implementing state management. Build a reusable UI component library using Styled Components and Storybook.
Day 16-20: Testing and Debugging

Learn how to test your React applications using Jest or other testing frameworks. Try the Testing React course on Pluralsight.
Debug common React errors, such as issues with state and props. Follow the Debugging React guide on the official documentation.
Implement error boundaries to improve the user experience. Follow the Error Boundaries guide on the official documentation.
Practice debugging and testing your React applications. Use the techniques learned in the courses and tutorials to debug and test your own projects.
Day 21-25: Optimize and Deploy

Learn how to optimize your React applications, such as code splitting, lazy loading, and caching. Try the React Performance course on Pluralsight.
Practice optimizing your application's performance using tools like Chrome DevTools and React Profiler. Follow the Performance Optimization guide on the official documentation.
Learn how to deploy your React application to a hosting service such as Heroku or Netlify. Try the Deploying React course on Scrimba.
Optimize your application for deployment by removing unused dependencies and optimizing the build process. Follow the Deployment guide on the official documentation.
Day 26-30: Advanced Topics

Learn advanced React concepts such as server-side rendering, hooks, and context. Try the Advanced React course on Frontend Masters.
Experiment with integrating React with other technologies such as Node.js, GraphQL, and Firebase. Follow the React and GraphQL course on Pluralsight.
Build a large-scale React project and practice collaborating with others using version control tools such as Git and GitHub. Use the techniques learned in the courses and tutorials to build a project with others.
Review your progress and identify areas for improvement. Keep learning and experimenting with React!
